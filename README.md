# LEMaddon-Template

This is an example.lemaddon file that you can download and edit to create custom maps for the Battle Minigames Server! (Rewrite 2.0)

Currently Battle map testing is not avaliable, if you would like to test your map go to the LEM-ToolBox Repository (There is currently no guide on how to use Toolbox at the moment so I would advise you to wait)

Please make sure you read the "TUTORIAL.txt" file before you begin creating custom maps, A better guide will be posted soon (Maybe)
